                    Also known as the Home Heat Cost Reduction Obligation, this obligation provides free boiler and
                    insulation grants to those who receive certain means-tested benefits. It aims to reduce fuel poverty
                    amongst low-income households by ensuring that heat is generated as efficiently as possible and is
                    prevented from escaping from the home.
                    The main purpose of The Affordable Warmth Obligation is to take fuel poverty and help
                    vulnerable families lower gas bills.
                    Old boilers significantly contribute to household expenses. Installing an energy-efficient gas
                    boiler can help to reduce gas bills by £100-£300 a year
                    If you qualify for a free boiler grant, apply for one today so you don’t miss out on the
                    government’s generous offer.

                        The primary obligations set by the government’s free boiler scheme are to reduce the country’s
                        carbon footprint and tackle fuel poverty. In order to reach its targets, energy suppliers in the
                        UK have been asked to help lower fuel consumption and reduce household energy bills by paying
                        for A-rated boilers to be installed in qualifying households.
                        Britain’s leading boiler manufacturers including Baxi and Gloworm have been working on
                        innovative designs to produce energy efficient boilers. The next stage of the plan is to
                        encourage UK homeowners to install energy efficient gas boilers.
                        Under the Affordable Warmth Obligation, energy suppliers have agreed to install replacement
                        boilers for free in households that cannot afford to purchase a new gas boiler.
                        It is anticipated that around 230,000 households in the UK will qualify for a free boiler grant.
                        However, the government aims to support over 1 million homeowners in total.
                        Thousands of households that are classed as ‘vulnerable’ may also be entitled to heavy
                        subsidies.
